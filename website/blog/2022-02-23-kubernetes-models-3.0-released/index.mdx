import Image from "@theme/IdealImage";

[kubernetes-models] 3.0 has been released last month. To upgrade to the latest `kubernetes-models`, run:

```shell
npm install kubernetes-models@latest
```

If you have installed any CRD packages, don't forget to upgrade them as well.

## Smaller Package Size

The package size of `kubernetes-models` 3.0 is reduced by 34% compressed, or 20% unpacked (compared to 2.0.2).

| Version | Unpacked | Compressed |
| ------- | -------: | ---------: |
| 2.0.2   |    5.9MB |      749KB |
| 3.0.1   |    4.7MB |      494KB |
| Diff    |  -20.33% |    -34.04% |

Several changes made the package size smaller in 3.0.

First, the following alias files are removed in 3.0. These alias files were introduced a few years ago. Removing these files can reduce the number of files and the size of the export map.

:::caution Breaking Change

If you are using any of these import patterns, please rewrite import paths after upgrading to 3.0.

- `kubernetes-models/api/core/v1/Pod`
- `kubernetes-models/api/apps/v1/Deployment`
- `kubernetes-models/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apis/apiextensions/v1/CustomResourceDefinition`

:::

Next, type definition files are used to be stored in `_definitions/<id>.js`. In 3.0, they are moved to `<apiVersion>/<kind>.js`. This can also reduce the number of alias files, and import paths can be shorter, too.

Last, a new type `TypeMeta` has been added to `@kubernetes-models/base` package. Interfaces with `apiVersion` and `kind` will extend `TypeMeta` type now. This can remove doc comments in each type.

```ts
// Before
export interface IIoK8sApiCoreV1Pod {
  /**
   * APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
   */
  apiVersion: "v1";
  /**
   * Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
   */
  kind: "Pod";
}

// After
export interface IPod extends TypeMeta {
  apiVersion: "v1";
  kind: "Pod";
}
```

## Better Import Suggestions

Type definition files are used to be stored in `_definitions/<id>.js`, which are supposed to be hidden files. But sometimes IDEs get confused and show them in import suggestions. In 3.0, they are moved to more proper locations, which should provide a better IDE experience.

Before:

<Image img={require("./import-path-before.jpg")} />

After:

<Image img={require("./import-path-after.jpg")} />

## API Machinery Package

A new package `@kubernetes-models/apimachinery` has been released with `kubernetes-models` 3.0. This package includes types defined in [kubernetes/apimachinery](https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery) only. All CRD packages have been migrated to import this package instead of the whole `kubernetes-models`. This can reduce the size of dependencies of CRD packages.

:::caution Breaking Change

If you are using API machinery files, please rewrite import paths as below.

```ts
// Before
import { IObjectMeta } from "kubernetes-models/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1/ObjectMeta";

// After
import { IObjectMeta } from "@kubernetes-models/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1/ObjectMeta";
```

:::

## Type Guard

All classes with `apiVersion` and `kind` now come with a new static method `is`, which can be used to narrow down object types. Please note that this function does **NOT** validate the object itself. It just checks whether `apiVersion` and `kind` match or not.

```ts
import { Pod } from "kubernetes-models/v1/Pod";

const thing = { apiVersion: "v1", kind: "Pod" };

if (Pod.is(thing)) {
  // thing is an `IPod`.
} else {
  // thing is something else
}
```

Type guards can also be used in the `transform` function of `@kosko/yaml`.

```ts
import { loadFile } from "@kosko/yaml";
import { Service } from "kubernetes-models/v1/Service";

loadFile("manifest.yaml", {
  transform(manifest) {
    // Set all service type as "ClusterIP"
    if (Service.is(manifest)) {
      manifest.spec.type = "ClusterIP";
    }

    return manifest;
  }
});
```

You can see [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates) for more information about narrowing and type predicates.
