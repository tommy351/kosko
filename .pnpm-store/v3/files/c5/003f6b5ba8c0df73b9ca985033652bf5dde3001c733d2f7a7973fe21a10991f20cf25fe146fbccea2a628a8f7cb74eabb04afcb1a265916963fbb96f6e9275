### Minor Changes

- [`12f9a43`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/12f9a433a6c3ac38f9405fcd77c9108c423d7101) [#507](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/507) Thanks [@zkochan](https://github.com/zkochan)! - New setting added: bumpVersionsWithWorkspaceProtocolOnly. When it is set to `true`, versions are bumped in `dependencies`, only if those versions are prefixed by the workspace protocol. For instance, `"foo": "workspace:^1.0.0"`.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`12f9a43`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/12f9a433a6c3ac38f9405fcd77c9108c423d7101)]:

### Minor Changes

- [`412b4b9`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/412b4b97e53b6326e8e733eb7d4e1f5738e6fed0) [#504](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/504) Thanks [@vitorbal](https://github.com/vitorbal)! - `changeset status` command no longer errors when no packages have been changed.

* [`24d7bc9`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/24d7bc9e56a6dce7c64b39e8f73e50e21762faac) [#495](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/495) Thanks [@RoystonS](https://github.com/RoystonS)! - Automatically deepen shallow clones in order to determine the correct commit at which changesets were added. This helps Git-based changelog generators to always link to the correct commit. From now on it's not required to configure `fetch-depth: 0` for your `actions/checkout` when using [Changesets GitHub action](https://github.com/changesets/action).

### Patch Changes

## 2.11.2

### Patch Changes

- [`b4e4b93`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/b4e4b938b985b4bcdd23c573bcaba81669f2cafe) [#448](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/448) Thanks [@vlad-zhukov](https://github.com/vlad-zhukov)! - Packages are now published from cwd (usually the root of the repository) rather than from the package directories. This respects `.npmrc` files put in the root directory.

### Minor Changes

- [`e33e4ca`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/e33e4ca7e71ba7747e21af5011057f11ddfab939) [#458](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/458) Thanks [@emmenko](https://github.com/emmenko)! - Allow glob expressions to be provided for the `linked` and `ignore` options

### Patch Changes

- [`d1d987c`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/d1d987c42cddff8be5d7f04d3ebb5a262779fa9f) [#455](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/455) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Fixed an issue with linked package being bumped when its dev dependency from the linked set was bumped during the versioning.

* [`9d99bd1`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/9d99bd16f2b6b3ab4fe820358d4c9f313cb2ae76) [#446](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/446) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Fixed an issue with dependant packages not being updated to their highest bump type in pre mode sometimes. This could happen when dependant packages were only versioned because of their dependencies being upgraded and not because of a dedicated changeset for those dependant packages.

  For the very same reason linked packages were also not always bumped correctly in pre mode to the highest bump type in a linked group.

* Updated dependencies [[`ab98fe3`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/ab98fe33814867ba740fc04733602be80771915c), [`d1d987c`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/d1d987c42cddff8be5d7f04d3ebb5a262779fa9f), [`9d99bd1`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/9d99bd16f2b6b3ab4fe820358d4c9f313cb2ae76)]:

### Minor Changes

- [`9006375`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/90063752a4c4f187fcb3dc30c833405f209d9c84) [#392](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/392) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Changed condition based on which single-package repositories are identified when creating tags after successful publish. It is now based on whether we have recognized the repository to be managed by monorepo tooling or not.

* [`9dcc364`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/9dcc364bf19e48f8f2824ebaf967d9ef41b6fc04) [#371](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/371) Thanks [@Feiyang1](https://github.com/Feiyang1)! - Added support for ignoring packages in the `version` command. The version of ignored packages will not be bumped, but their dependencies will still be bumped normally. This is useful when you have private packages, e.g. packages under development. It allows you to make releases for the public packages without changing the version of your private packages. To use the feature, you can define the `ignore` array in the config file with the name of the packages:

  ```
  {
    ...
    "ignore": ["pkg-a", "pkg-b"]
    ...
  }
  ```

  or you can pass the package names to the `--ignore` flag when using cli:

  ```
  yarn changeset version --ignore pkg-a --ignore --pkg-b
  ```

## 2.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [`6d0790a`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/6d0790a7aa9f00e350e9394f419e4b3c7ee7ca6a) [#359](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/359) Thanks [@ajaymathur](https://github.com/ajaymathur)! - Add support for snapshot flag to version command. Usage: `changeset version --snapshot [tag]`. The updated version of the packages looks like `0.0.0[-tag]-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` where YYYY, MM, DD, HH, MM, and SS is the date and time of when the snapshot version is created. You can use this feature with the tag option in the publish command to publish packages under experimental tags from feature branches. To publish a snapshot version of a package under an experimental tag you can do:

  ```
  $ # Version packages to snapshot version
  $ changeset version --snapshot
  $ # Publish packages under exprimental tag, keeping next and latest tag clean
  $ changeset publish --tag exprimental
  ```

* [`6d0790a`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/6d0790a7aa9f00e350e9394f419e4b3c7ee7ca6a) [#359](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/359) Thanks [@ajaymathur](https://github.com/ajaymathur)! - Add support for tag flag to publish command. Usage: `changeset publish --tag <tag>`. This will publish the packages under passed npm tag.

* [`5dc389f`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/5dc389f9cc03a59ef44f34243efe8ad00e35d465) [#376](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/376) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Changed what git tag is generated for single-package repositories after successful publish. The package name is being skipped and the scheme matches what `npm version` generates, so for example `v2.8.0`.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`6d0790a`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/6d0790a7aa9f00e350e9394f419e4b3c7ee7ca6a)]:

### Minor Changes

- [`a679b1d`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/a679b1dcdcb56652d31536e2d6326ba02a9dfe62) [#204](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/204) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Respect `publishConfig.access` in workspace package.jsons

  Previously, every package in your repository had one 'public' or 'restricted' setting.

  Now, if a workspace has `publishConfig.access` in its package.json, we will prioritize it over the global changesets config.

- [`51a0d76`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/51a0d766c7064b4c6a9d1490593522c6fcd02929) [#182](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/182) Thanks [@ajaymathur](https://github.com/ajaymathur)! - Updated the package to use the new `@changesets/logger` for logging.

### Patch Changes

- [`5ababa0`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/5ababa08c8ea5ee3b4ff92253e2e752a5976cd27) [#201](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/201) Thanks [@ajaymathur](https://github.com/ajaymathur)! - Updated to use the Error classes from the @changesets/errors package

* [`a679b1d`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/a679b1dcdcb56652d31536e2d6326ba02a9dfe62) [#204](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/204) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Correctly handle the 'access' flag for packages

  Previously, we had access as "public" or "private", access "private" isn't valid. This was a confusing because there are three states for publishing a package:

  - `private: true` - the package will not be published to npm (worked)
  - `access: public` - the package will be publicly published to npm (even if it uses a scope) (worked)
  - `access: restricted` - the package will be published to npm, but only visible/accessible by those who are part of the scope. This technically worked, but we were passing the wrong bit of information in.

  Now, we pass the correct access options `public` or `restricted`.

## 2.0.0

Welcome to version 2 🎉🦋

Quickest summary of the most exciting changes:

🦋 Changesets (the written files) have a new format! They are now human readable/writeable

🦋 The config options have been completely rethought to be clearer and more concise

🦋 Changesets has been significantly decomposed, allowing an easier time building tools on top of it

### Major Changes

- [ca8ff585](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/ca8ff585) [#147](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/147) Thanks [@Noviny](https://github.com/Noviny)!

  #### Changed command line argument names

  We have removed command line arguments that overrwrite the config. The following commands can no longer
  be passed in:

  - `updateChangelog`
  - `isPublic`
  - `skipCI`
  - `commit`

  This has been done to avoid overloading the number of ways you can pass options, as within any single
  repository, there should be a single consistent way in which these values are always provided.

- [ca8ff585](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/commit/ca8ff585) [#147](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/pull/147) Thanks [@Noviny](https://github.com/Noviny)!

  #### Changed how Config works

  The Changesets config is now written in JSON with fewer options. The new defaults are shown below.

  ```json
  {
    "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/@changesets/config/schema.json",
    "changelog": "@changesets/cli/changelog",
    "commit": false,
    "linked": [],
    "access": "private"
  }
  ```

  **Reasoning**: Having a JSON config makes it easier to build other tools on changesets because the config can be read without executing user code that could potentially be unsafe. It also means we can have easy autocompletion and descriptions in editors that don't go out of date like the comments in the JS config along with being able to packagise changelog entry generators.

  ##### Migrating

  1. Run `yarn changeset init` to create a config file in the new format at `.changeset/config.json`
  1. If you're using changelogs, move `getReleaseLine` and `getDependencyReleaseLine` to their own module and set the changelog option to the path to the module. If you're not using changelogs, set the changelog option to `false`. In the future, we will be providing packages to write changelogs for common use cases
  1. Set `access` to `"public"` if `publishOptions.public` is `true`, otherwise set it to `"private"`
  1. If you use `linked`, copy your linked package groups from the JS config to the the JSON file
  1. If you use `commit` and `skipCI` in `versionOptions` or `publishOptions`, set commit to `true`, all commits will include a skip ci message. if you have a use case for only using commit on one command or not including a skip ci message by default, contact us and we will talk about re-implementing these features.
  1. Delete `.changeset/config.js`

  #### Changelog generation functions have minor changes

  In addition to how these functions are defined (see changes to config), the data that is passed through
  to these functions is notably different to what it was before. For the most part, the changelog functions
  simply receive richer information, based on the new changelog format.

  **BREAKING**: The release objects and dependency release objects now use `release.newVersion` for the latest
  version, instead of the previous `release.version`.

  The `@changesets/types` package includes exports for both `GetReleaseLine` as well as `GetDependencyReleaseLine`.

  If you were using the default changelog generation scripts, you won't need to worry. Otherwise, we recommend updating
  your command and manually running `version` to ensure you are still getting the changelogs you expect.

  **Looking further forward** We are already aware that we want to change how people write these generation functions,
  including opening up more flexibility, and access to things such as the underlying release plan. This will likely require
  a breaking change in the future, but we thought we were changing enough this release that we didn't want too much turmoil. 😁

  #### Renamed commands

  - `bump` has been renamed to `version`
  - `release` has been renamed to `publish`

  This is a reversion to the changes made in `1.0.0`.

  **Reasoning**: We switched the names because we wanted to avoid confusion with the related
  tasks in npm. While technically it removed confusion that this was doing the same thing as
  `npm version`, or `npm publish`, the new terms did not convey easily grokkable meanings. As
  we weren't benefiting from the new names, we have decided to revert to names that have more
  meaning within the community, even though these commands do slightly more than this.

### Minor Changes

### Minor Changes

- [16fde2e0](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/16fde2e0) [#75](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/75) Thanks [@mitchellhamilton](https://github.com/mitchellhamilton)! - Use [enquirer](https://github.com/enquirer/enquirer) instead of inquirer for asking questions because it's smaller, faster and prettier.
  Change bump type questions from asking for each bump type individually per package to asking users to two questions where the user selects what packages should have major and minor bumps and the packages left are assumed to be patch bumps. This dramatically cuts down the amount of time it takes to create a changeset with a large number of packages.

  ![example of using the CLI with the new questions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11481355/58873398-a1c4de80-8709-11e9-80e8-16061e395b15.gif)

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 9435d886: Fix binary and published files

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 51c8b0d6: Remove `noChangelog` flag in favor of `updateChangelog` flag (default behaviour remains the same).

  If you were using this custom flag, you will need to replaces `noChangelog: true` with `updateChangelog: false`

- 51c8b0d6: Rename commands from @atlaskit/build-releases

  We are no longer mirroring the names from npm/yarn commands, so it is easy to write package scripts
  for each command without footguns. The functionality of the commands remains the same. In addition,
  the binary has been changed to `changeset`.

  The new names are:

  - `build-releases initialize` => `changeset init` (for ecosystem consistency)
  - `build-releases changeset` => `changeset` (default command). You can also run `changeset add`
  - `build-releases version` => `changeset bump`
  - `build-releases publish` => `changeset release`

  The function of these commands remains unchanged.

  - 51c8b0d6: Change format of changelog entries

  Previously changelog entries were in the form of:

  ```md
  ## 2.1.0

  - [patch] Allows passing --public flag for publishing scoped packages [159c28e](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/159c28e)
  - [minor] Changes changelogs to be opt out rather than opt in [f461788](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/f461788)
  ```

  which doesn't take into account the importance of particular entries. We are moving to an ordered system for changelog
  entries, and to match this, we are updating the headings we use to the following format:

  ```md
  ## 2.1.0

  ### Minor

  - Allows passing --public flag for publishing scoped packages [159c28e](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/159c28e)

  ### Patch

  - [minor] Changes changelogs to be opt out rather than opt in [f461788](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/f461788)
  ```

  This changes the format of the default `getReleaseLine` from

  ```js
  const getReleaseLine = async (changeset, versionType) => {
    const indentedSummary = changeset.summary
      .split("\n")
      .map(l => `  ${l}`.trimRight())
      .join("\n");

    return `- [${versionType}] ${changeset.commit}:\n\n${indentedSummary}`;
  };
  ```

  to

  ```js
  const getReleaseLine = async (changeset, type) => {
    const [firstLine, ...futureLines] = changeset.summary
      .split("\n")
      .map(l => l.trimRight());

    return `- ${changeset.commit}: ${firstLine}\n${futureLines
      .map(l => `  ${l}`)
      .join("\n")}`;
  };
  ```

  You will end up with some odd changelog entries if you do not update your release line.

### Minor Changes

- 51c8b0d6: Support non-bolt repositories

  Changesets have been expanded to support:

  - bolt repositories
  - yarn workspaces-based repositories
  - single package repositories.

  Currently **not** supported: bolt repositories with nested workspaces.

  To do this, functions that call out to bolt have been inlined, and obviously marked
  within the file-system. In addition, the `get-workspaces` function has undergone
  significant change, and will be extracted out into its own package soon.

  This is to support other tools wanting this level of inter-operability.

  If plans to modularize bolt proceed, we may go back to relying on its functions.

  This should have no impact on use.

  - 51c8b0d6: Add 'select all' and 'select all changed' options, to make mass-bumping easier.
  - eeb4d5c6: Add new command: `status` - see Readme for more information

# @atlaskit/build-releases - legacy changelog

## 3.0.3

- [patch][c87337f](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/c87337f):

  - The version command now removes empty folders before it starts. This should prevent a race condition in CI

## 3.0.2

- [patch][f7b030a](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/f7b030a):

  - Fixes potential infinite loop in parseChangesetCommit

## 3.0.1

- [patch][494c1fe](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/494c1fe):

  - Update git commit message to match previous tooling.

## 3.0.0

- [major][44ec8bf" d](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/44ec8bf"
  d):

  Changesets now use local file system - this has several effects:

  1. Changesets will no longer automatically create a commit. You will need to add and commit the files yourself.
  2. Changesets are easier to modify. You should ONLY modify the changes.md file (_Not changes.json_).
  3. There will be a new directory which is `.changeset`, which will hold all the changesets.

  Apart from these changes, your process using this should not have changed.

  Changeset now accepts skipCI flag, where previously release commits automatically skipped CI. i.e.

  ```
  yarn build-releases version --skipCI
  ```

  **Breaking**: Changeset and version commands now accept `--commit` flag which makes them commit automatically (previously this was the default behaviour). Otherwise, these commands simply make the file-system changes.

  ```
  yarn build-releases changeset --commit
  ```

  We also introduce the `intitialize` command. See the package [README.md](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atlaskit/build-releases) for more details about this.
